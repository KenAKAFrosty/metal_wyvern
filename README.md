-   [x] Step 1 - Keep as is, but in Rust. Serve the same ONNX model on an axum server.

-   [x] Step 2 - Convert ONNX model to Burn model, just run inference via that model with Burn

Step 3 - Try different training and architectures, all within Burn, updating and serving as needed

-   [x] Step 3a - First, just keep exact same architecture and re-build a system for gathering/generating training data. Train one from scratch and also try continuing training on current model weights

-   [x] Step 3b - Then with that data available (and the pipeline for more working), try fully new architectures. Def try transformer

Now actively in 3B. First trying simple things like removing MaxPool. But will be working toward fresh arch and training, like transformer and EGGROLL respectively.
